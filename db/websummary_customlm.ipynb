       "'\\n        The Sarkaz Mercenary reports to Hoederer that they have lost the rebels who attacked their camp, describing them as crafty sand beasts. Hoederer tells the mercenary to guard their position until the rebels appear again. Another mercenary enters and comments on Hoederer\\'s loyalty from his men, to which Hoederer responds that it\\'s a result of Manfred\\'s successful plan. The mercenary hints at Hoederer\\'s past, but Hoederer changes the subject, advising the mercenary to be careful of the shadows, suggesting mercenaries are not trustworthy.\\n\\nIn a separate background, Mandragora gives orders to her Dublinn Soldier in preparation for an operation to rescue Heidi Thomson. She tells the soldier they will leave Londinium after their mission, expressing her disdain for the city. The soldier shares his own negative feelings towards Londinium and its stench, prompting Mandragora to assign him to tail Manfred. She also selects the ten best fighters for the rescue mission and sets off to complete it, stating her determination to not disappoint their leader again.\\n\\n\\nThe first dialogue is between Mandragora and an unidentified Dublinn Soldier. Mandragora expresses her intentions to rescue their \"spy\" in Londinium. Despite staying there for a long time, she feels the need to accomplish something before leaving, as she doesn\\'t want to let their leader down.\\n\\nIn the second dialogue, Horn returns from a mission and checks on his team. He learns that no medicine was found for Salley, whose daughter\\'s name is unknown to him. Horn insists on visiting Salley\\'s family and paying them a visit once the war is over. Victorian Soldier delivers a message from Salley, stating \"Sorry, Lieutenant, but you must live on.\"\\n\\nThe third dialogue takes place between Clovisia, Amiya, Doctor, and other unidentified individuals. They discuss the probable locations where the Sarkaz might be keeping their prisoners. Clovisia mentions there are eight locations that could fit the requirements, but it\\'ll be difficult to search all of them in the given time frame. Doctor suggests making the abandoned candy factory their top priority, as they suspect Mr. Thomas, who has been working with the Sarkaz, may own it. This compound, known as \"Loxic Kohl,\" is something the Sarkaz don\\'t want anyone to know about.\\n\\nIn this scene, Clovisia, the commander of the Self-Salvation Corps, is informed that one of her soldiers, Lawrence, was captured by the Sarkaz mercenaries while on reconnaissance. The sage, Rockrock, arrives with news that a social gathering attended by Lady Golding and the Messenger lady (who earlier helped them enter Victoria) was ambushed, and the Messenger was taken prisoner. Further, they discover that this Messenger is the same person who helped Doctor, Kal\\'tsit, and Amiya of Rhodes Island enter Victoria. It is revealed that she holds valuable information about Victoria and hence the urgency for their rescue operation. Clovisia, hearing this, declares that it\\'s now a joint operation between the Self-Salvation Corps and Rhodes Island as the Messenger is crucial for both sides. They all have faith in the strength and the alliance of Rhodes Island.\\n        '"

At the same time, Rhodes Island and the Self-Salvation Corps also plan their own operation to rescue Messenger Heidi Thomson, who has been captured by the Sarkaz.”\\n\\n\\n<Background 1>\\n\\n\\nSarkaz Mercenary\\n\\nBoss, you were right. We lost them.Those rebels... Crafty little sand beasts, the lot of them. Just five seconds, and it\\'s like they all burrowed into the sand without a trace.\\n\\n\\nHoederer\\n\\nSure enough, and that\\'s why we shouldn\\'t waste our energy on them.Guard your position well, until they poke their heads out of their holes again.\\n\\n\\nSarkaz Mercenary\\n\\nSure. You\\'re the boss.\\n\\n\\n[The Sarkaz mercs leave as someone talks with Hoederer.]\\n\\n\\n???\\n\\nLooks like you found yourself a bunch of loyal subordinates, \"Boss.\"\\n\\n\\nHoederer\\n\\nThey think it\\'ll pay dividends. It\\'s good for morale.\\n\\n\\n???\\n\\nThey trust you too. I can tell. It\\'s far more than what a mercenary should afford another mercenary.\\n\\n\\nHoederer\\n\\nJust goes to show how effective Manfred\\'s plan is.\\n\\n\\n???\\n\\nYou think real highly of him. I almost forgot. You two are practically brothers from another mother these days, right? Just look at the mansion he gave you. The den alone is larger than your old backyard.\\n\\n\\nHoederer\\n\\nIt was a count\\'s estate. I killed its previous owner.\\n\\n\\n???\\n\\nDon\\'t tell me that\\'s weighing on your conscience.\\n\\n\\nHoederer\\n\\nHe was having afternoon tea at the time... His wife and their three children were sitting right in front of him.\\n\\n\\n???\\n\\nSure, this is nothing like the kind of work we used to take, but you\\'re the one who agreed to the job. Nothing to mourn when our consciences died so long ago.\\n\\n\\nHoederer\\n\\nThen let\\'s not ask these questions. Whatever it is you want to know, just take a look for yourself. Not like you don\\'t know already.\\n\\n\\n???\\n\\nIs you being under a lot of stress supposed to somehow make me feel better?Whatever. Let\\'s talk about something else. It\\'s not the time for us to find comfort in each other. I\\'m here because I have some advice for you—Pay attention to what\\'s under your feet.\\n\\n\\nHoederer\\n\\nYou mean...\\n\\n\\n???\\n\\nMercenaries aren\\'t all that trustworthy.If you don\\'t pay attention to the shadows when you walk, your efforts might just be all for naught.\\n\\n\\nHoederer\\n\\nIs that all you came here for?\\n\\n\\n???\\n\\nNo, that\\'s not all.What I really wanted to say is–After drifting around for so long, she\\'s on the road.\\n\\n\\n<Background fades out and in>\\n\\n\\nMandragora\\n\\nAre our men in position?\\n\\n\\nDublinn Soldier\\n\\nYes, all at that place per the Sarkaz\\'s orders.\\n\\n\\nMandragora\\n\\nDon\\'t be daft. I\\'m not talking about what the Sarkaz want us to do.\\n\\n\\nDublinn Soldier\\n\\nCaptain, are we really going to start this operation tonight? Are you sure we won\\'t...\\n\\n\\nMandragora\\n\\nYou trying to ask if we\\'ll fall into Manfred\\'s trap?Do you think I\\'m so stupid that I can\\'t tell what he\\'s trying to do?\\n\\n\\nDublinn Soldier\\n\\nNo, of course not... I wouldn\\'t dare to...\\n\\n\\nMandragora\\n\\nHe\\'s trying to test me, and I\\'ll let him test me.Our men are his to order around... but he doesn\\'t know how many of us there are.\\n\\n\\nDublinn Soldier\\n\\nSo, we still have to be the Sarkaz\\'s gatekeepers, then?\\n\\n\\nMandragora\\n\\nShut up.I hate putting it that way. It makes it sound as though we\\'re the Sarkaz\\'s... the Sarkaz\\'s...Gah, whatever. We just have to bear with it today. Once we\\'re done with this last thing, we\\'ll leave Londinium straight away.\\n\\n\\nDublinn Soldier\\n\\nW-Will we really? That\\'s wonderful news!Ever since I was a kid... I... I\\'ve always hated Londinium. My parents both came to this place and never went back...This city eats people!\\n\\n\\nMandragora\\n\\nRight, I don\\'t like it either. Have you ever seen another city like this? So many plates, so many tall towers, and so many sewers?Every time I smell that stench... The smell of grease on the nobles\\' dining tables, it makes me want to puke.And now we can finally leave.Get the word out, and put on your best performance tonight. Do not give Manfred anything he can use against us.And I want the ten best fighters to come with me.As for you, I want you to tail Manfred... You saw where he was heading, right?\\n\\n\\nDublinn Soldier\\n\\nYes, Captain.\\n\\n\\nMandragora\\n\\nGood.Tonight, I\\'ll rescue our \"spy.\"I\\'ve stayed here in Londinium for so long, I have to at least get one thing done before I can go home with my mind at ease, right?I... I won\\'t let our leader down again.\\n\\n\\n<Background 2>\\n\\n\\nVictorian Soldier\\n\\nHorn, you\\'re back!\\n\\n\\n[Horn walks in.]\\n\\n\\nHorn', metadata={'source': 'https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/10-8/Story', 'title': '10-8 story | Arknights Wiki | Fandom', 'language': 'en'})"
