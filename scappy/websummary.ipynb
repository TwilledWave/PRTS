Talulah Phantom Crossbowmen, I\\'m glad to see you\\'ve returned safely.You brought so many. Are they all our people from Lungmen? Phantom Crossbowman There are so many Infected... who came back with us.I didn\\'t think we\\'d meet you here. Talulah We can save a lot of lives making full use of Chernobog\\'s resources . This core city will be our final weapon to breach Lungmen. Phantom Crossbowman What? No, my Leader...Why was Lungmen so different from what we planned? So many of our comrades died back there for nothing! Reunion Member You dare speak to the leader like this...? Talulah No, he\\'s right.Many of our dear friends have suffered so much. The enemy left a lot of treacherous traps for us that disrupted our plans. It was a major setback.However, even if our pioneers faced some obstacles, the Reunion Movement will avenge them. I shall see to it that your wounds, your sacrifices, are made whole again.Worry not. We will be with you, always. Phantom Crossbowman ...I hope so, Leader. Talulah Hmm... The person you\\'re carrying... Mephisto? Is he.........Faust sacrificed himself to save him, didn\\'t he? Phantom Crossbowman ...That\\'s right, Leader. With no regard for his own life, Faust used his Arts to cover our tracks and give us a chance to escape. Talulah Oh?......Phantom Crossbowmen, my people of Reunion... Faust will live on forever in our hearts.Help him down. Mephisto will need to rest awhile.I will have some men take you to camp. Phantom Crossbowman Another thing, Leader... We lost contact with Crownslayer early on. We haven\\'t heard anything from her. Don\\'t know where she might have ended up.As for... Yeti Squad, and FrostNova, they... they\\'re all... Talulah —Truly unfathomably tragic news.Please, allow me... some time to myself. Talulah ......Sarkaz, do not let them near any of our Reunion units in the city. Sarkaz Warrior How far do we go? Talulah All the way. See to it that they never set foot here. Talulah Could they be hiding something, or have they been digging around? Their team must know something I don\\'t.Maybe... that battle was somewhat transformative. Those Arts were already exceptional, and he was not talkative....He cloaked himself in his silence. I thought Faust would be the one to survive.But then, this isn\\'t so strange either. Amiya Looks like the core city is back up to speed. It didn\\'t stop for long.On the upside, that should have been Reunion taking in a group of Infected migrants from Lungmen. I hope... Kal\\'tsit But we may have to change up our strategy.We can expect the city to make a few more stops along the way until the enemy commander decides to announce her plan. Then she\\'ll stop taking in Infected refugees.At that time, should Wei Yenwu decide to attack, the enemy will redeploy their defensive units. We may be exposed in the process, and come under attack. Amiya I hope our agreement with Miss Fumizuki will buy us some time from Chief Wei...Hm.. we\\'re already very close to the center of the core city.There are a lot of passages above and below us that seem like they were part of the city\\'s transit system. After the Catastrophe, everything stopped working.That does mean it\\'s impossible for the city to function, and even move...? Could this be the underground structure Dr. Kal\\'tsit was talking about?Regardless, these passages make good cover for us. The number of enemy guards has nearly doubled in this storage area close to the central district...We haven\\'t seen much resistance since entering the core city. But once we proceed to the central district, we should expect to run into a lot more Reunion forces. Kal\\'tsit The recon and spec ops teams are already in position. So far so good. Doctor Why do we only have three teams working together? Kal\\'tsit The recon and spec ops teams both have their own missions.Raidian is leading the recon team for this operation, as one of Rhodes Island\\'s communications specialists.Thanks to Raidian, the recon team serves as the focal point for our comms in this operation.Even here in the core city, we\\'ll be able to communicate with the other teams. That\\'s because of their hard work. Doctor I didn\\'t see them... Kal\\'tsit The recon team always works alone.Outcast, Raidian, and Scout, who heroically gave his life in the Chernobog rescue mission–The elite operators leading the recon teams are responsible for leading their squads alone, identifying and reporting threats, and attempting to resolve them without assistance.Raidian isn\\'t as skilled in combat as the other two elite operators, but she is a unique talent at Rhodes Island when it comes to directly influencing the course of a battle.We\\'ve got three teams engaging in this assault operation. We don\\'t need Raidian to trouble herself with combat.As for the spec ops team, their mission also avoids direct combat. Doctor Explain it to me. / ...... / So you\\'re not going to tell me what it is? Kal\\'tsit It\\'s enough to know that they\\'re necessary. You\\'ll know the details soon enough.Each team makes up a link in the chain of our strategy. That stable structure breeds a stable result.Conversely, a formidable opponent has a tangled and twisted root structure. They pull in nutrients from every level. Hacking off branches does them no harm.We have to set their roots alight before they even know we\\'re here. Doctor Huh? What are you talking about? / ...... / I think I get it. Kal\\'tsit Heh. I\\'m pretty sure you get it all...\"Doctor.\" Rosmontis Wait a second.Some distant, vague feelings are coming to me.An orderly, unchanging flow, with no conflict....Ironclad. And they\\'re moving. Amiya Reunion\\'s... guard team. Let\\'s avoid them and find another way...No time to lose. Kal\\'tsit –Amiya. Amiya Dr. Kal\\'tsit? Kal\\'tsit Careful. Can\\'t you feel it?Attention, operators... protective gear on. Amiya ...It couldn\\'t be... Rosmontis? Are you feeling any anomalies? Rosmontis Hm...? No. I don\\'t think so. Kal\\'tsit This is beyond Rosmontis\\'s Arts.You can\\'t rely entirely on emotions, Amiya. There is more to feel than feelings alone. When you run your fingers through a head of hair, the first thing you feel is neither longing nor joy. It\\'s something more base than that. Amiya Base...? Kal\\'tsit You can go back up to the surface from the depths, Amiya. Only you can. Amiya Then I\\'ll try, Dr. Kal\\'tsit. [Amiya heads to the surface, but...] Amiya Nnh... There\\'s a sliver of... energy. And a strong scent in the air, like......a corpse?No, this isn\\'t a real corpse. Could it be...? No. Oh? Why...?...It\\'s Sarkaz. Sarkaz Arts. Thick with the smell of death... A ritual...? Kal\\'tsit It\\'s an ancient ritual that runs itself after taking shape.These are not modern Arts. Definitely not a modern tactic. Doctor Are Sarkaz Arts unique? Amiya They are. This is very unusual. The Sarkaz we know today can\\'t perform Arts like these.I understand what you mean, Dr. Kal\\'tsit. This is an ancient Sarkaz ritual, not a product of the modern science of Originium Arts. Kal\\'tsit Our enemy here may be of the \"purest\" Sarkaz. These are techniques not known to any modern country, passed down only among ancient Sarkaz and Sargonian nomads. Amiya ...The ritual relies on Oripathy infection, and the caster\\'s peculiar understanding of Originium.The chaotic energy is seeping out of the Originium core, spilling out and enveloping the entire block.I can\\'t even imagine how the potent tempest at the center of the ritual would affect a living being.It wouldn\\'t know the difference between friend or foe... any living thing would be slowly pulled apart by the waves of energy.It doesn\\'t seem useful for modern combat. The cost far outweighs any potential gain. Kal\\'tsit \"Cannibalism.\"The phrasing may seem alarmist, but that\\'s how this ritual is called.It\\'s not surprising that the device at the center of the ritual is called an altar, considering how horrifically destructive it is. That the uninitiated refer to this as \"witchcraft.\" Amiya I... I don\\'t think ordinary Sarkaz mercenaries know how to use these kinds of Arts.You would have to have extensive Arts knowledge and combat experience from Kazdel to be able to pull off this ritual. And you wouldn\\'t actually need to be a caster.But he... he\\'s only a Kazdel Sarkaz. Not one of the descendants of the ancient Sarkaz still wandering around the world....Dr. Kal\\'tsit, is this second layer of protective equipment designed to protect against the Sarkaz Arts? Kal\\'tsit Not entirely. The amount of energy the ritual is producing exceeds the maximum tolerance of our equipment.This ritual can only be completed successfully in a city lost to Catastrophe.Our gear will not negate the effects of the ritual. Its power derives from antiquity, and cannot be separated from it.All we can do is mitigate its lethality, and destroy it after clearing the area.A Sarkaz ritual is not only a challenge to modern technology.It\\'s almost as if it\\'s standing to once again challenge the other civilizations of this world, as the Sarkaz have plotted throughout history. Doctor It\\'s a metaphor. Kal\\'tsit Yes. But Sarkaz history is more than metaphorical.The Reunion element guarding Chernobog is not a typical group. I\\'ve said as much already.Reunion may very well rely on \"hubs\" in \"neural networks\" to operate as a single unit on a large scale.But for today\\'s purely push-strategy driven environment, Reunion would be something of an anomaly.Imagine if soldiers who could not deal with the Infected, with no training in how to fight Sarkaz, infiltrated the core city...They would suffer a crushing defeat. Amiya ...Right.Then... let me think......Dr. Kal\\'tsit, look, I think, if... Kal\\'tsit –Alright.If you don\\'t need my assistance, Dr. {nickname}. Doctor Huh? / ...... / Is there something I can help with? Kal\\'tsit Please help Amiya command the operation.You will evaluate the progress of the battle. Amiya Roger!Rosmontis, we\\'re moving out!We\\'ll vacate the area after this battle and head to the core city surface!Rosmontis... at least it\\'ll be sunny. Rosmontis Sunny~ [Amiya and Rosmontis runs off.] Kal\\'tsit (......)(Heh. Look at them.)(The rest is up to you, Dr. {nickname}. I know you won\\'t let us down.) [The Originium Altars are highlighted.] 12F Those structures pulsing with a strange energy... what are they? They seem to be a byproduct of Sarkaz Originium Arts...Dr. Kal\\'tsit has reminded us of this before, but there\\'s no telling what tricks Reunion has up their sleeves. This may be the enemy\\'s secret weapon.Though we\\'ve taken all the steps to keep ourselves protected, that thing will still cause harm to our Operators, so make sure to keep your distance.Patriot\\'s guerrillas also seem to have taken some protective measures, but there\\'s no way to completely offset the harm of this weapon.Squads with no exposure to the Sarkaz\\'s mysterious rituals may suffer heavy losses because of these strange structures...' metadata={'stage': '7-8', 'episode': 'Episode 07', 'characters': \"Doctor,12F,Amiya,Kal'tsit,Rosmontis,Phantom Crossbowman,Talulah,Chernobog Perimeter,Ursus Streets,Underpass\", 'source': 'https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/7-8/Story', 'indexed': True}\n",
